Participants are invited to submit an extended abstract or short papers (up to 4 pages in ICRA format) focusing on novel advances in spatial perception, reinforcement learning, and at the boundary between these research areas. 
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
- Novel algorithms for spatial perception that combine geometry, semantics, and physics, and allow reasoning over spatial, semantic, and temporal aspects;
- Learning techniques that can produce cognitive representations directly from complex sensory inputs;
- Approaches that combine learning-based techniques with geometric and model-based estimation methods;
- Novel transfer learning and meta-learning methods for reinforcement learning;
- Novel RL approaches that leverage domain knowledge and existing (model-free and model-based) methods for perception and planning; and
- Position papers and unconventional ideas on how to reach human-level performance in robot perception and task-execution. 
Contributed papers will be reviewed by the organizers and a program committee of invited reviewers. Accepted papers will be published on the workshop website and will be featured in spotlight presentations and poster sessions.

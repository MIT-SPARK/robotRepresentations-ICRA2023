This workshop brings together researchers from robotics, computer vision, and machine learning to examine challenges and opportunities emerging at the boundary between spatial perception and high-level task execution. Recent years have seen a growing interest towards metric-semantic understanding, which consists in building a semantically annotated (or object-oriented) model of the environment. This is pushing researchers from traditional research on SLAM towards more advanced forms of spatial perception. On the other hand, researchers have been looking at high-level task execution using modern tools from reinforcement learning and traditional decision making. The combination of these research efforts in perception and task execution has the potential to enable applications such as visual question answering, object search and retrieval, and are providing more intuitive ways to interact with the user. This workshop creates an exchange opportunity to connect researchers working in metric-semantic perception and high-level task execution. In particular, the workshop will bring forward the latest breakthroughs and cutting-edge research on spatial perception and high-level task execution. Besides the usual mix of invited talks and poster presentations, the workshop involves two interactive activities. First, we will provide a hands-on tutorial on a state-of-the-art library for metric-semantic reconstruction, which can be useful to both researchers and practitioners. Second, we will organize the GOSEEK challenge (details to follow), in conjunction with the release of a photo-realistic Unity-based simulator, where participants will need to combine perception and high-level decision making to find an object in a complex indoor environment.
